## The Uluru Team

This project was created by Marina Caro, Raquel González, Laura Moreno and Titika Apostolaki as part of their training in a bootcamp organized and implemented by [Adalab](https://adalab.es/) (Promo Salas, 2023).

It is an exercise in responsive web design which also serves as a presentation of our team. We formed the Uluru Team which was named after the Uluru sandstone formation located in Australia's northern territory. Why Australia? The answer is simple: it was the ideal holiday destination we chose for all of us in our first meeting. A place where we all could find a part of ourselves and our team as a whole.
